"""YoleHandler: extends GenericAgentHandler with approval interception.

The approval gate sits in front of `super().dispatch()`. We keep GA's tool
execution path as the authority, and only add Yole's approval + progress
signals around it. GA upgrades can move internals around; this module uses
runtime feature detection for the pieces Yole depends on.

This module imports GA modules (`agent_loop`, `ga`). The caller must put
the GA installation path on sys.path before importing this module.

# commit, but the user's local GA repo may not be — and we are
# explicitly non-invasive (AGENTS.md "GA upgrade cadence is the user's
# call"). So we detect support at import time and forward `tool_num`
# only when the actually-loaded BaseHandler supports it. Without this
# guard, an older GA crashes the agent loop with `TypeError: dispatch()
# takes from 4 to 5 positional arguments but 6 were given` on the
