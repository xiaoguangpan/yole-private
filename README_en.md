# Galley

> **A GenericAgent-based local agent team orchestrator desktop — native for both human and agent.**

> *Galley started as a workbench for [GenericAgent](https://github.com/lsdefine/GenericAgent). The first two letters of our name are a quiet bow to where we came from.*

## What is Galley

Galley is a desktop app for running multiple AI agent sessions in parallel — and, after v0.5, for letting one **Supervisor Agent** drive the whole team remotely.

**Today (v0.1)** Galley is a desktop workbench for [GenericAgent](https://github.com/lsdefine/GenericAgent): you run several agent sessions side-by-side, watch their tool calls in a structured timeline, approve high-risk actions when you want to (or let them rip with YOLO mode), and pick up old sessions where you left off.

**After v0.5** Galley becomes **dual-native**: a Rust `Galley Core` exposes both the existing GUI and a new `Galley CLI`. The CLI lets an external **Supervisor Agent** — running on the same machine as a separate GenericAgent process plugged into IM frontends like WeChat or Lark — orchestrate the entire session team. You text the Supervisor from your phone, it calls `galley` commands locally; back at the desk, every session is right there in the GUI.

Galley is **local-first**. Your data never leaves your machine. **Remote access** is the Supervisor's responsibility (via IM, SSH, whatever), not Galley's.

Galley doesn't touch your existing GenericAgent. Delete Galley anytime — GA keeps working untouched.

## Features

### Today (v0.1)

- 🪟 **Multi-session parallel** — each session runs as an independent GenericAgent subprocess
- 🔧 **Structured tool timeline** — see every tool call, args, result, and timing inline with the conversation
- 🛡️ **Approval system + YOLO mode** — pause for high-risk actions (file_patch, code_run, ...), or trust your agent and skip
- 💾 **Session persistence + restore** — close Galley, come back days later, pick up where you left off
- 📁 **Projects + full-text search** — organize sessions by project; SQLite FTS5 search across all conversations
- 🤖 **Per-session LLM switching** — switch models mid-conversation without losing context

### Coming in v0.5

- 🚧 **Galley CLI** — `galley sessions list / send / new / watch / ...` for Supervisor Agent control
- 🚧 **Background mode** — close the window, keep running in the menubar
- 🚧 **Agent-API public contract** — versioned JSON schema for stable agent integration
- 🚧 **Galley Supervisor SOP** for GenericAgent + **galley-supervisor** Skill for Claude

See the [PRD](./docs/PRD.md) and [refactor playbook](./docs/refactor/) for the full v0.5 plan.

```

**v0.1 ships today**: only the GUI box is real; logic currently lives in the TypeScript layer. **v0.5 introduces Galley Core in Rust**, which then exposes the CLI box. See the [refactor playbook](./docs/refactor/) for execution detail.

**Tech stack:**

- **Frontend** — Tauri v2 + React 19 + TypeScript 5.8 + Tailwind v4
- **Backend** — Rust (Galley Core, v0.5 in progress) + Python (runner, wraps GenericAgent)
- **Local DB** — SQLite (FTS5 trigram for search)
- **IPC** — JSON Lines over stdio today; Unix socket / named pipe for CLI in v0.5
- **Platform** — macOS + Windows (Linux candidate post-v0.5)

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Galley wraps [GenericAgent](https://github.com/lsdefine/GenericAgent). Install GA first by following [the hello-generic-agent tutorial](https://datawhalechina.github.io/hello-generic-agent/part1/chapter1/). At minimum you need:

- GenericAgent cloned to `~/Documents/GenericAgent/` (or any path; Galley lets you pick on first launch)
- Python 3.10+ with GA's dependencies installed
- A configured `mykey.py` with at least one LLM provider (Galley dogfoods primarily with Claude Opus 4.6, GPT 5.5, and GLM 5.1)

Galley will run a health check on first launch and tell you exactly what's missing.

### macOS

1. Download `Galley-v0.x.x-aarch64.dmg` (Apple Silicon) or `Galley-v0.x.x-x86_64.dmg` (Intel) from [Releases](https://github.com/wangjc683/galley/releases)
2. Open the .dmg and drag **Galley.app** to your **Applications** folder
3. Galley isn't code-signed yet. To open it the first time, run this in Terminal:
   ```bash
   xattr -d com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Galley.app
   ```
   Then double-click Galley.app to launch. *(Alternative: right-click the app → Open → Open again. The `xattr` command is more reliable on recent macOS versions.)*

### Windows

1. Download `Galley-v0.x.x-x64-setup.exe` from [Releases](https://github.com/wangjc683/galley/releases)
2. Run the installer. Windows SmartScreen will warn that the publisher is unknown (Galley isn't EV-signed):
   - Click **"More info"** → **"Run anyway"**
3. Launch Galley from the Start menu

## Acknowledgments

[**lsdefine/GenericAgent**](https://github.com/lsdefine/GenericAgent) — the agent framework Galley is built on — is a self-evolving LLM agent organized around a single principle: **contextual information density maximization**. Rather than chasing raw context length, it keeps the active context small and decision-relevant through four interlocking mechanisms — a minimal atomic tool set, a hierarchical on-demand memory that surfaces only a small high-level view by default, a self-evolution layer that distills past trajectories into reusable SOPs and executable code, and a context truncation/compression layer that maintains density during long executions. The reasoning, tool dispatch, memory consolidation, and SOP system all come from GA. Galley adds a desktop workbench and (in v0.5) a CLI for agent-driven orchestration, while staying strictly non-invasive — delete Galley and GA keeps working untouched.
