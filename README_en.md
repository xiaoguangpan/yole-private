## What Is Galley

Galley runs multiple AI agent sessions in parallel on your own computer. Humans use the GUI to watch progress, send instructions, and approve actions; Supervisor Agents use the CLI to orchestrate the same session team.

| For Humans | For Agents | Ready By Default |
|---|---|---|
| Manage sessions, projects, tool timelines, and approvals in the GUI | The `galley` CLI is a stable contract for Supervisor Agents | Bundled GenericAgent runtime, CPython 3.11, runtime dependencies, and Browser Control setup assets |

Already have your own [GenericAgent](https://github.com/lsdefine/GenericAgent) environment? Connect it from **Settings -> Runtime**. Galley does not modify your external GA code, memory, SOP, or `mykey.py`.

## Highlights

| | |
|---|---|
| 📦 **Out of the box**<br/>Bundled GenericAgent runtime, CPython 3.11, and runtime dependencies. | 🪟 **Multi-session + projects**<br/>Run multiple tasks in parallel; humans and Supervisor Agents see the same workbench. |
| ⚙️ **GUI + CLI dual-native**<br/>Humans operate in the GUI; Supervisor Agents operate through the stable `galley` CLI. Both share the same sessions and history. | 💬 **IM integration path**<br/>WeChat, Feishu/Lark, QQ, Telegram, Discord, and other GA IM frontends come with the bundled GA runtime. |
| 🔒 **Localhost-only**<br/>Core listens only on a Unix socket / Windows named pipe; remote transport belongs to the Supervisor Agent. | 🔧 **Tool timeline + approvals**<br/>Tool calls, args, results, and timing are shown inline; risky actions can use approval, allowlists, or YOLO mode. |
| 🌐 **Browser Control**<br/>After connecting Chrome/Chromium, the agent can operate your signed-in browser. There is a lot of room to explore. | 💾 **Persistence + search + background mode**<br/>Close the window, keep working via a Supervisor Agent, then come back to continue or search past sessions. |

## Quick Start

Prepare a usable LLM service first: API Key, Base URL, and model name.

| 1. Download Galley | 2. Configure a model | 3. Start using it |
|---|---|---|
| Download the macOS / Windows installer from [Releases](https://github.com/wangjc683/galley/releases). | On first launch, enter your API Key, Base URL, and model name. | Click "Test and start using Galley" to enter the main conversation view. |

| Platform | Installer |
|---|---|
| macOS Apple Silicon | filename contains `macOS_aarch64.dmg` |
| macOS Intel | filename contains `macOS_x64.dmg` |
| Windows x64 | filename contains `Windows_x64-setup.exe` |

<details>
<summary>Install notes</summary>

Galley is not code-signed yet. If macOS blocks the first launch, run:

```bash
xattr -d com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Galley.app
```

On Windows, when SmartScreen says the publisher is unknown, choose "More info" -> "Run anyway".

If you already have a GenericAgent environment, choose the GA folder from **Settings -> Runtime -> Connect external GA**.

</details>

## Supervisor / IM

In the running GUI, open **Settings -> Agent**:

| Button | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Copy SOP** | Copies [`galley-supervisor-sop.md`](./docs/integrations/galley-supervisor-sop.md), so your Agent can learn how to dispatch and orchestrate Galley |
| **Open Agent API docs** | Opens the full command reference, JSON schemas, and exit codes |

You do not need to learn the CLI yourself. Tell your Supervisor Agent what you want in natural language, and let it decide how to operate Galley. IM integration currently uses SOP + CLI first; a one-click GUI setup path will come later.

<details>
<summary>Show CLI examples</summary>

When Galley is running, a Supervisor Agent on the same machine can dispatch tasks through `galley`:

```bash
# What's running right now?
galley status
galley sessions list

# Start a new session to follow up on a PR
galley session new --project=proj_work \
  --supervisor=ga-claude-1 --reason="follow up on PR review" \
  "look at the feedback on #1234"

# Watch one session's event stream
galley session watch <id>

# Switch model / archive / restart
galley llm set <id> "another model name"
galley session archive <id> --supervisor=ga-claude-1 --reason="done"
```

Every command carries an origin triple (`via=supervisor`, `supervisor=ga-claude-1`, `reason=...`). The GUI timeline annotates supervisor-issued work with "@ga-claude-1 · follow up on PR review · 2 min ago" so the human can see what happened at a glance.

Full command reference, JSON schemas, and exit codes live in [`docs/agent-api.md`](./docs/agent-api.md).

## Architecture

Both GUI and CLI talk to the same Rust Core. Core owns session lifecycle, SQLite writes, runner management, and event broadcasting.

```text
+----------------+                  +----------------+
|   Galley GUI   |---+          +---|   Galley CLI   |
|  Tauri/React   |   |          |   |      Rust      |

                     v          v
              +------------------------+        localhost only
              |      Galley Core       | <----  unix socket / named pipe
              |          Rust          |        0600 / no token / no TLS
              |  - session lifecycle   |
              |  - SQLite authority    |
              |  - runner + events     |
              +-----------+------------+
                          |
             +------------+------------+
             v                         v
       +------------+             +------------+
       | Runner #1  |     ...     | Runner #N  |        one per session
       |  Python    |             |  Python    |
       +-----+------+             +------+-----+
             |                           |
             +------------+--------------+
                          v
              +------------------------+
              |   Galley-managed GA    |
              | - GenericAgent kernel  |
              | - Galley prompt profile|
              | - bundled CPython 3.11 |
              | - bundled dependencies |
              +------------------------+
```

1. GUI and CLI are **peer frontends**, not GUI wrapping CLI.
2. **Rust Core is authoritative** for session state, SQLite writes, and runner lifecycle.
3. The default path is **Galley-managed GA**: GenericAgent is the bundled agent kernel.

**Tech stack:** Tauri v2 + React 19 + TypeScript 5.8 + Tailwind v4 / Rust (Galley Core + Galley CLI) / Python (runner, wraps GenericAgent) / SQLite + FTS5 trigram

## Why "Galley"?

A ship's galley is both kitchen and workbench. Everyone comes there for a different reason, but **the table is the same table**.

Galley is that shared table: humans drive work from the GUI, while Supervisor Agents manage the team through the CLI. Both share the same sessions, history, and decision log instead of living in separate tabs.

> *Galley started as a workbench for [GenericAgent](https://github.com/lsdefine/GenericAgent). The first two letters of our name are a quiet bow to where we came from.*

## Acknowledgments

[**lsdefine/GenericAgent**](https://github.com/lsdefine/GenericAgent) is Galley's current agent kernel. Galley's bundled runtime is built on GenericAgent while preserving compatibility with external GA environments; Galley adds local orchestration, peer GUI / CLI frontends, session persistence, approvals, search, and an out-of-the-box packaged experience.
