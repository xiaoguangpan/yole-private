# Galley

> This is the short startup constitution for AI coding agents working in this

## Product Shape

Galley is a local agent team orchestrator. Human and agent are both first-class
operators:

- Galley GUI is for the human operator at the desktop.
- Galley CLI is for trusted Agent / Supervisor automation on the same machine.

Current target:

- Version: `0.2.0-beta.1`
- Release tag: `v0.2.0-beta.1`
- Agent API: `schemaVersion: 1`
- Release tier: beta prerelease; do not mark GitHub Release as Latest

Read [project status](./docs/project-status.md) for the current milestone,
release gates, and compact phase state.

## Names And Terms

- Use `Galley` in prose, docs, comments, and commit messages.
- Use `GALLEY` only for small wordmark display already designed that way.
- Use `GenericAgent` / `GA` for the upstream engine, never as a synonym for
  Galley.
- `macOS` means the operating system; `Mac` means the hardware / user device.

## Non-Negotiable Rules

Violating any rule below breaks the core project contract.

### 1. Non-Invasive To GenericAgent

Galley must not modify GenericAgent state:

- Do not edit files under `~/Documents/GenericAgent`.
- Do not write GenericAgent `memory/`.
- Do not overwrite GA venv, PATH, or environment variables.
- Do not monkey-patch `agent_runner_loop` or GA tool implementations.

Allowed integration points:

- Start GA as a child process per session.
- Use GA public APIs such as `agent.list_llms()`.
- Register `agent._turn_end_hooks`.
- Subclass `GenericAgentHandler` only for approval interception.
- Read / inject `llmclient.backend.history` for restore.

Reading GA internals is allowed only when read-only and documented as a coupling
point. Anything that reads and then writes GA files counts as modification and
is forbidden.

Supervisor SOP is copy-first: Settings -> Agent provides "Copy SOP". Galley does
not install SOP content into GA memory. Read
[Supervisor SOP](./docs/integrations/galley-supervisor-sop.md).

### 2. Localhost Only

Galley Core listens only on AF_UNIX socket / Windows named pipe. It does not
open TCP, expose HTTP, or hold remote auth tokens.

Remote use cases belong to the external Supervisor transport layer, such as an
IM bot, SSH, or another agent frontend.

Any proposal to add HTTP server, token auth, remote login, or TLS must first
change this constitution.

### 3. CLI Surface Is Public Contract

Galley CLI JSON is the stable contract for agents. Read
[agent-api](./docs/agent-api.md) before changing it.

- `schemaVersion: 1` is frozen for `v0.2.0-beta.1`.
- v1 changes are additive-only.
- Breaking change requires `schemaVersion: 2`.
- CLI callers pin with `--schema=1`.
- Socket callers pin with `schemaVersion: 1`.
- Exit code classes and error identifiers are stable.

Changing the Agent API is riskier than changing GUI copy: a GUI change affects
humans; schema drift breaks downstream agents and SOPs.

### 4. Data Stays In Galley

Galley stores session data and supervisor action metadata. It does not store the
conversation between a supervisor and the user in IM / Claude / another agent.

Supervisor history belongs to the supervisor. Galley is an orchestrator, not a
chat platform.

### 5. Rust Core Is Authoritative

Since v0.2, business authority lives in Rust Galley Core:

- SQLite writes: Rust
- Bridge subprocess ownership: Rust
- Session lifecycle and command dispatch: Rust
- GUI / CLI: presenter frontends that invoke commands and subscribe to events

Do not reintroduce GUI-side authoritative writes, GUI-side Python subprocess
ownership, or a new monolithic frontend state owner.

### 6. Tauri Identifier Is Data-Critical

The Tauri identifier controls the user data directory. Do not change
`app.galley` without a migration plan and dogfood. Read
[desktop runtime](./docs/desktop-runtime.md).

## Working Defaults

- Prefer the existing architecture and local patterns over new abstractions.
- Keep edits scoped to the user's request.
- Preserve unrelated dirty work.
- For code changes, run the smallest verification set that covers the risk.
- For release or contract changes, broaden verification.

Common verification:

```bash
cargo check --workspace
cargo test --workspace
pnpm --dir gui typecheck
pnpm --dir gui lint
git diff --check
```

Desktop dogfood:

```bash
pnpm --dir gui tauri dev
```

This is a client app. Do not treat `pnpm dev` alone as full verification unless
the task is explicitly web-only.

## Documentation Discipline

- `CLAUDE.md` should stay short and global.
- Put task detail in focused docs under `docs/`.
- Put decision history and rejected alternatives in [devlog](./docs/devlog/README.md).
- Update [docs index](./docs/README.md) when adding a major new document.

## Session Close

When the user asks to end, close, or "session close" a long coding session,
follow [Session Close SOP](./docs/session-close-sop.md): summarize outcome,
persist durable decisions, update docs/devlog if needed, verify, clean the
workspace, commit, and leave a short handoff.
