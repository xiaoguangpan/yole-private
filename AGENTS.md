## Product Shape

Yole is a local agent team orchestrator. Human and agent are both first-class
operators:

- Yole GUI is for the human operator at the desktop.
- Yole CLI is for trusted Agent / Supervisor automation on the same machine.

Current target:

- Agent API: `schemaVersion: 1` (frozen for the `0.2.x` line; see Rule 3)

Read [project status](./docs/project-status.md) for the current version, release
tag, release gates, update-channel state, and compact phase state. Those values
change every release and are intentionally not pinned here.

## Names And Terms

- Use `Yole` in prose, docs, comments, and commit messages.
- Use `Yole` for the product name in UI display too; do not introduce an
  all-caps product wordmark.
- Use `GenericAgent` / `GA` for the upstream engine, never as a synonym for
  Yole.
- `macOS` means the operating system; `Mac` means the hardware / user device.

## Non-Negotiable Rules

Violating any rule below breaks the core project contract.

### 1. GenericAgent Runtime Boundaries

Yole has two GenericAgent runtime modes:

- **Attach / external GA**: user-owned GenericAgent. Yole wraps it.
- **Managed / bundled GA**: Yole-owned runtime. Yole ships and maintains it.

For attach / external GA, Yole must not modify GenericAgent state:

- Do not edit files under the user's GenericAgent checkout.
- Do not write external GA `memory/`, SOP, skills, or other user state.
- Do not overwrite external GA venv, PATH, or environment variables.
- Do not inject Yole Persona or managed-runtime patches.
- Do not monkey-patch `agent_runner_loop` or GA tool implementations.

Allowed attach-mode integration points:

- Start external GA as a child process per session.
- Use GA public APIs such as `agent.list_llms()`.
- Register `agent._turn_end_hooks`.
- Subclass `GenericAgentHandler` only for approval interception.
- Read / inject `llmclient.backend.history` for restore.

Reading GA internals is allowed only when read-only and documented as a coupling
point. Anything that reads and then writes GA files counts as modification and
is forbidden.

Supervisor SOP is copy-first: Settings -> Agent provides "Copy SOP". Yole does
not install SOP content into GA memory. Read
[Supervisor SOP](./docs/integrations/yole-supervisor-sop.md).

For managed / bundled GA, Yole may patch and configure only its own managed
runtime, under the managed-runtime rules in
[managed GA runtime](./docs/managed-ga-runtime.md):

- Keep patches minimal, isolated, documented, and replayable on top of upstream.
- Prefer explicit extension seams over broad edits.
- Do not fork GenericAgent into a divergent product.
- If upstream GA provides the same capability, remove the Yole patch.
- Code is replaceable; user state is not. Runtime upgrades may replace managed
  GA code, but must not overwrite managed GA memory, SOP, skills, or other
  user state.
- Managed-runtime changes must never write into or depend on a user-owned
  external GA checkout.

### 2. Localhost Only

Yole Core listens only on AF_UNIX socket / Windows named pipe. It does not
open TCP, expose HTTP, or hold remote auth tokens.

Remote use cases belong to the external Supervisor transport layer, such as an
IM bot, SSH, or another agent frontend.

Any proposal to add HTTP server, token auth, remote login, or TLS must first
change this constitution.

### 3. CLI Surface Is Public Contract

Yole CLI JSON is the stable contract for agents. Read
[agent-api](./docs/agent-api.md) before changing it.

- `schemaVersion: 1` is frozen for `v0.2.x`.
- v1 changes are additive-only.
- Breaking change requires `schemaVersion: 2`.
- CLI callers pin with `--schema=1`.
- Socket callers pin with `schemaVersion: 1`.
- Exit code classes and error identifiers are stable.

Changing the Agent API is riskier than changing GUI copy: a GUI change affects
humans; schema drift breaks downstream agents and SOPs.

### 4. Data Stays In Yole

Yole stores session data and supervisor action metadata. It does not store the
conversation between a supervisor and the user in IM / Claude / another agent.

Supervisor history belongs to the supervisor. Yole is an orchestrator, not a
chat platform.

### 5. Rust Core Is Authoritative

Since v0.2, business authority lives in Rust Yole Core:

- SQLite writes: Rust
- Bridge subprocess ownership: Rust
- Session lifecycle and command dispatch: Rust
- GUI / CLI: presenter frontends that invoke commands and subscribe to events

Do not reintroduce GUI-side authoritative writes, GUI-side Python subprocess
ownership, or a new monolithic frontend state owner.

### 6. Tauri Identifier Is Data-Critical

The Tauri identifier controls the user data directory. Do not change
`app.yole` without a migration plan and dogfood. Read
[desktop runtime](./docs/desktop-runtime.md).

## Working Defaults

- Prefer the existing architecture and local patterns over new abstractions.
- Keep edits scoped to the user's request.
- Preserve unrelated dirty work.
- For code changes, run the smallest verification set that covers the risk.
- For release or contract changes, broaden verification.

Common verification:

```bash
cargo check --workspace
cargo test --workspace
pnpm --dir gui typecheck
pnpm --dir gui lint
git diff --check
```

When the change touches `runner/` (Python bridge), also run:

```bash
.venv/bin/python -m pytest          # unit tests (e2e is deselected by default)
.venv/bin/python -m mypy runner     # strict typing
.venv/bin/ruff check runner         # lint
```

The e2e suite needs a real GA + LLM and is opt-in:
`GA_PATH=… BRIDGE_PYTHON=… .venv/bin/python -m pytest -m e2e`.

Desktop dogfood:

```bash
pnpm --dir gui tauri dev
```

This is a client app. Do not treat `pnpm dev` alone as full verification unless
the task is explicitly web-only. Do not spend verification time opening the
Vite-only app in a browser for Settings, updater, IPC, database, menu/tray, or
other Tauri-dependent flows: it lacks the Tauri runtime and will produce
expected API errors. Use `pnpm --dir gui tauri dev` or static checks instead.

## Documentation Discipline

- `AGENTS.md` should stay short and global.
- Put task detail in focused docs under `docs/`.
- Put decision history and rejected alternatives in [devlog](./docs/devlog/README.md).
- Update [docs index](./docs/README.md) when adding a major new document.

## Session Close

When the user asks to end, close, or "session close" a long coding session,
follow [Session Close SOP](./docs/session-close-sop.md): summarize outcome,
persist durable decisions, update docs/devlog if needed, verify, clean the
workspace, commit, and leave a short handoff.
