# Background Mode · Tray Lifecycle

## Date / Status / Related

2026-05-26. Implemented.

Related: `core/src/lib.rs`, `core/src/runner_manager/manager.rs`,
`gui/src/App.tsx`, `core/icons/tray-template.png`,
`core/icons/tray-windows.png`, [desktop runtime](../desktop-runtime.md).

## Context

Galley often runs long Agent tasks or acts as the local endpoint for an
external Supervisor / IM frontend. In that shape, closing the desktop window
should not silently tear down the local runtime. The previous desktop behavior
treated app lifecycle like an ordinary document app; that is wrong for a local
agent orchestrator.

## Decisions

- Background Mode is default on. There is no first-version setting because the
  user-facing goal is reliability, not preference management.
- Closing the main window hides it. It does not quit Galley Core.
- True quit is explicit through `Quit Galley`.
- macOS keeps the Dock icon for now and also shows a right-side menu bar status
  item.
- Because the Dock icon remains visible, clicking it after the main window was
  hidden must restore and focus the window. Users should not have to notice the
  menu bar status item, especially on notched MacBook displays.
- Windows uses the system tray for the same open / hide / quit path.
- The tray / status item first action is dynamic: `Open Galley` when hidden,
  `Hide Galley` when visible.
- Tray click behavior is platform-specific: macOS keeps left click as the menu
  action and treats right click as an auxiliary restore/focus action; Windows
  uses left click to open/hide the main window and right click for the tray
  menu.
- The tray / status item also exposes `New Chat`, `Settings`, and
  `Check for Updates...` because those are the common background-entry actions.
- Tray menu grouping uses separators to keep the mental model clear: return to
  work, manage the app, then explicit quit.
- True quit confirms only when an Agent task is currently running.
- The first tray icon is a simplified version of the existing app icon:
  template monochrome on macOS, slightly branded but quiet on Windows.
- The macOS app menu also gets `Check for Updates...`, wired to Settings ->
  About and the existing updater check.

## Rejected Alternatives

- First-close confirmation: rejected because the default close behavior is now
  intentionally non-destructive. A confirmation would add noise without saving
  work.
- Background Mode setting in v1: rejected for now. The product needs one
  reliable lifecycle model before exposing preferences.
- Hiding the Dock icon on macOS: deferred. It may be cleaner later, but keeping
  Dock presence is less surprising while Background Mode is new.
- Tray running / approval badges: deferred. Useful eventually, but a static
  first icon keeps the first implementation simple and avoids inaccurate state
  hints.
- Treating close and quit the same: rejected because it breaks long task and
  external Supervisor use cases.

## Open Questions

- Whether macOS should eventually hide its Dock icon when Background Mode is
  active.
- Whether the tray / status item should later show running, waiting-for-user, or
  approval-needed state.
- Whether tray menu labels should join the full localization pass or remain
  native-style English for the first beta.

## Next

Dogfood the installed desktop app on macOS and Windows: close window, reopen
from status item / tray, run true quit with and without an active task, and
check tray icon contrast in light and dark modes.
