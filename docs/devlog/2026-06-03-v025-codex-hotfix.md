# 2026-06-03 - v0.2.5 Codex backend hotfix

## Date / Status / Related

- Date: 2026-06-03
- Status: Stable hotfix release prep for `v0.2.5`; `v0.2.4` is published as
  GitHub Latest and remains the beta update-channel target until `v0.2.5`
  installer smoke passes.

## Context

`v0.2.4` shipped the ChatGPT / Codex managed model provider, but real dogfood
found that the first implementation treated the Codex backend too much like the
public Responses API. OAuth itself and Codex CLI credential import worked, but
the automatic model probe failed on backend-specific request validation.

The failures were sequential and useful: first `input` had to be a list, then
`stream` had to be `true`, then `max_output_tokens` was rejected as unsupported.
After removing the incompatible parameter and forcing Codex streaming, local
dogfood confirmed Codex CLI import, model test, and a managed-GA conversation.

## Decisions

- Release `v0.2.5` as a narrow stable hotfix instead of waiting for a larger
  feature release.
- Keep the ChatGPT / Codex provider in managed-GA only; this fix does not
  change Attach GA boundaries.
- Treat the Codex backend as its own protocol variant, not a generic OpenAI
  Responses endpoint.
- Hide the stream toggle in Codex advanced settings because Codex requires
  streaming and the switch would imply a control that cannot actually work.
- Omit `max_output_tokens` for Codex backend requests while leaving it available
  for ordinary OpenAI-compatible Responses providers.

## Verification

- `cargo test -p galley-core codex_probe_payload`
- `cargo check --workspace`
- `.venv/bin/python -m pytest runner/tests/test_workbench_bridge.py`
- `.venv/bin/python -m mypy runner/managed_runtime.py`
- `pnpm --dir gui typecheck`
- `pnpm --dir gui lint`
- `git diff --check`
- Manual dogfood: Codex CLI login import succeeded, model probe succeeded, and a
  managed-GA conversation completed using the ChatGPT / Codex provider.

## Rejected alternatives

- Reusing the public Responses payload unchanged: the backend rejected multiple
  standard-looking parameters, so the request shape must be Codex-specific.
- Keeping `stream` configurable: users should not see an option that produces a
  known invalid Codex request.
- Shipping the fix only after more unrelated polish: `v0.2.4` is already Latest,
  and the broken path is a newly promoted setup path.

## Next

Bump package metadata to `0.2.5`, tag `v0.2.5`, let `release.yml` build a draft
GitHub Release, rewrite the draft notes for review, smoke installers, then
publish and promote the beta update channel after smoke passes.
