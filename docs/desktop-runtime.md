# Desktop Runtime

> Maintainer-facing document for packaging, app data, and runtime policy.

This document covers desktop packaging and runtime invariants: Tauri app data,
identifier safety, unsigned releases, bundled Python, and Mac / Windows notes.

## Tauri Identifier

Tauri `identifier` binds the app data directory on all supported platforms:

- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/{identifier}/`
- Linux: `$XDG_DATA_HOME/{identifier}/` or `~/.local/share/{identifier}/`
- Windows: `%APPDATA%/{identifier}/`

Galley currently uses `app.galley`. SQLite data for sessions, projects,
tool events, prefs, and migrations lives under that identifier-controlled data
directory.

Changing the identifier without migration makes user data appear to vanish,
because the app starts reading an empty new directory.

## Identifier Change Rule

Do not change the Tauri identifier unless the same change includes:

1. Rust-side startup migration from old data directory to new data directory.
2. Fallback copy / rename behavior if the new DB is missing but the old DB
   exists.
3. Dogfood using a manually seeded old data directory.
4. Release notes explaining the one-time migration.

Historical lesson: the 2026-05-13 rename from `app.gaworkbench` to `app.galley`
made sessions appear missing during dogfood. The data was not lost; the app was
looking at a new directory.

## Signing Strategy

Pre-v1.0 Galley ships unsigned:

- macOS `.app` / `.dmg` are not codesigned or notarized.
- Windows `.exe` / NSIS installer is not signed with an EV certificate.
- Release notes must explain first-launch friction.

Current decision, 2026-05-18: unsigned is acceptable for the current personal
open-source stage. Re-evaluate before v1.0 or when user scale makes manual
Gatekeeper / SmartScreen bypass too costly.

Expected user flow:

- macOS: right click the app, choose Open, then confirm the Gatekeeper dialog.
- Windows: SmartScreen -> More info -> Run anyway.

Any PR adding `codesign`, `notarytool`, or `signtool.exe` should also update
this policy and [release workflow](./release-workflow.md).

## Auto Update Runtime

Galley checks for app updates on startup and exposes the current update state in
Settings -> About / Runtime. Update delivery is enabled only for builds that
provide both compile-time variables:

- `GALLEY_UPDATER_PUBKEY`: Tauri updater public key embedded in the app.
- `GALLEY_UPDATER_ENDPOINT`: HTTPS URL for the updater manifest.

Current beta endpoint:

```text
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wangjc683/galley/galley-update-channel/updates/beta/latest.json
```

Without both values, the app reports that this build is not connected to an
update channel and local development keeps working. This is intentional: Tauri
updater package verification is mandatory and should not be bypassed just
because Galley itself is still unsigned at the OS level.

Update installation is task-protected. If any session is actively running,
Galley may remember that an update is available, but it will not download,
install, or relaunch for that update until the session is idle. This avoids
turning a background maintenance action into a lost-task event.

Tauri updater signing is separate from macOS codesigning / Windows Authenticode.
The private updater key must stay in release secrets; only the public key is
safe to embed in app builds.

Release builds opt into signed updater artifacts by generating
`core/tauri.updater.generated.conf.json` inside CI. The default
`tauri.conf.json` intentionally does not enable `createUpdaterArtifacts`, so
local Dev and unsigned local builds do not require `TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY`.

The release workflow creates a candidate `latest.json` as a draft Release asset.
After smoke test and publishing the release, run the manual
`promote-update-channel.yml` workflow to update the beta manifest that installed
apps read.

## Bundled Python

Since v0.1.1, Galley release builds embed CPython 3.11.15 plus GenericAgent core
dependencies. Users do not need to configure Python or a venv for normal use.

Implementation notes:

- Source: `python-build-standalone` install-only stripped builds.
- Script: `scripts/bundle-python.sh`.
- Output: `core/python-bundle/python/` generated per target arch.
- Tauri resource: `python-bundle/python/` is bundled as `$RESOURCE/python/`.
- Tauri aliases:
  - `python-bundled` for macOS / Linux (`bin/python3`)
  - `python-bundled-win` for Windows (`python.exe`)
- User escape hatch: `gaConfig.useExternalPython = true`.
- Dev mode uses external Python because `$RESOURCE` does not point at the final
  bundle resource directory during `pnpm tauri dev`.

Bundled GenericAgent core deps are audited during baseline upgrades. See
[GA baseline](./ga-baseline.md).

## Managed GenericAgent Runtime

Managed / bundled GA keeps code and state separate:

- App resources contain `managed-ga/manifest.json`, `managed-ga/code/`, and
  `managed-ga/patches/`.
- Application Support contains `managed-ga-state/` and
  `managed-model-config/`.

Galley may replace the managed code payload during an app update, but it must
not overwrite managed state. Startup may create missing state directories only.
Advanced diagnostics can show managed runtime paths, baseline commit, and patch
stack status; diagnostics must never display API keys.

The managed-runtime product and upgrade rules live in
[managed GA runtime](./managed-ga-runtime.md).

## Release Artifacts

Current release path:

- macOS Apple Silicon DMG via CI.
- macOS Intel DMG via CI cross-compile path where available, local fallback if
  needed.
- Windows x64 NSIS installer via CI.

The release-day checklist lives in [release / update SOP](./release-update-sop.md).
The detailed release process lives in [release workflow](./release-workflow.md).
Windows manual smoke lives in [windows build checklist](./windows-build-checklist.md).

## Platform Terminology

- `macOS` means the operating system. Use for platform names, system
  requirements, and release titles.
- `Mac` means the hardware family or user device.
- Release title examples:
  - `Galley v0.2.0-beta.1 · macOS (Beta)`
  - `Galley v0.2.0-beta.1 · Windows (Beta)`
