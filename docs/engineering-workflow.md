# Engineering Workflow

> Contributor-facing document. Coding agents should still start from
> [CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md); human contributors should start from
> [CONTRIBUTING](../CONTRIBUTING.md).

This document holds the engineering conventions that do not need to live in
every agent startup context.

## Repository Map

```text
galley/
├── README.md
├── README_en.md
├── CLAUDE.md
├── runner/                  # Python bridge into GenericAgent
├── core/                    # Rust Galley Core + Tauri backend
├── cli/                     # Rust `galley` CLI
├── gui/                     # React / Tauri frontend
├── docs/                    # Product, architecture, workflow, devlog
└── .github/workflows/       # CI and release workflows
```

Key directories:

- `runner/`: Python bridge, GenericAgent handler subclass, IPC dataclasses,
  runner tests.
- `core/`: Rust authoritative layer, SQLite migrations, Tauri commands,
  socket / named pipe listener, bundled resources.
- `cli/`: Agent-facing `galley` command.
- `gui/`: React 19 + Tauri frontend, Zustand domain stores, visual components.
- `docs/refactor/`: B-phase implementation playbooks and invariants.
- `docs/devlog/`: decision provenance and historical narrative.

## Common Commands

From repo root unless noted:

```bash
cargo check --workspace
cargo test --workspace
pnpm --dir gui typecheck
pnpm --dir gui lint
pnpm --dir gui build
pnpm --dir gui tauri dev
pnpm --dir gui tauri build
git diff --check
```

Inside `gui/`, the shorter forms also work:

```bash
pnpm typecheck
pnpm lint
pnpm tauri dev
pnpm tauri build
```

`pnpm tauri dev` is the normal desktop dogfood command. It runs the client app,
not a web-only experience.

## Python Runner Rules

- Python 3.10+.
- Type annotations are expected.
- Keep runner code independent from GUI.
- Do not introduce third-party packages beyond GenericAgent dependencies unless
  the need is clear.
- Cover IPC schema, hook behavior, and subprocess isolation in `runner/tests/`.

## TypeScript / GUI Rules

Toolchain:

- Tauri v2
- Vite 7
- React 19
- TypeScript strict
- Tailwind v4 CSS-first tokens in `gui/src/styles/globals.css`
- Phosphor Icons as the product icon set
- Self-hosted fonts through npm packages
- pnpm only

Component guidance:

- Use shadcn/Radix-style primitives for standard accessible behaviors:
  dialog, dropdown menu, popover, tabs, tooltip, command, input, button.
- Use local product components for domain-specific surfaces:
  Sidebar, Composer, Tool callouts, Approval Dock, Health Check, Onboarding,
  Empty State.
- Keep UI state in the relevant domain store. The old monolithic
  `useAppStore.ts` no longer exists.

Design references:

- [DESIGN.md](./DESIGN.md)
- [design handoff](./design-handoff/README.md)
- [devlog design entries](./devlog/README.md)

## IPC Protocol Changes

Protocol is a contract. Change docs first, then code.

1. Update [ipc-protocol](./ipc-protocol.md).
2. Update Python IPC dataclasses in `runner/ipc.py` when runner protocol is
   affected.
3. Update TypeScript mirror types in `gui/src/types/ipc.ts` when GUI protocol is
   affected.
4. Update Rust command / event types when Galley Core protocol is affected.
5. Add or adjust tests in the same change.

For Agent-facing CLI JSON, read [agent-api](./agent-api.md). That surface is
more stable than internal GUI IPC.

## Git Discipline

- Preserve user or other-agent work in a dirty tree.
- Keep commits independently working when the user asks for commits.
- Use English commit messages that explain intent.
- Do not push unless explicitly asked.
- Keep baseline upgrades as separate commits when possible.

## Devlog Workflow

Use [devlog](./devlog/README.md) for decision provenance:

- major architecture or product decisions
- meaningful rejected alternatives
- phase changes
- release or dogfood retrospectives

File naming:

```text
docs/devlog/YYYY-MM-DD-topic-in-kebab-case.md
```

Each entry should cover:

1. Date / Status / Related
2. Context
3. Decisions
4. Rejected alternatives
5. Open questions
6. Next

After writing a devlog, update [devlog README](./devlog/README.md).
