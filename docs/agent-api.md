# Galley Agent API

The contract between **Galley** and any agent that drives it via the
`galley` CLI binary or the Unix-socket / named-pipe local transport.

> **Status: B4 M6 — `schemaVersion: 1` FROZEN for `v0.2.0-beta.1`.** All 19
> commands documented in §5 are wired, tested, and locked. Inside
> `schemaVersion: 1` the rules in §1 hold: additions are non-breaking;
> renames / removals require a `schemaVersion: 2` bump. Pre-freeze
> adjustments (camelCase version output, flattened error envelope)
> shipped under M6 as part of locking the contract. See
> [refactor playbook](./refactor/README.md) for the post-freeze
> roadmap (background mode, supervisor activity GUI, migration).

## 1 · Stability

The CLI output schema **and the socket wire format** are both part of
Galley's public contract — supervisor agents and Skills depend on
them. We commit to the rules in
[CLAUDE.md "Galley 架构原则 §2 CLI surface 是公开契约面"](../CLAUDE.md).

- **`schemaVersion: 1` is additive-only.** New optional fields can
  arrive on requests and responses; existing field names and semantics
  do not change inside this major version.
- **Breaking change requires a bump.** A `schemaVersion: 2` introduces
  the breaking change, and old SOPs can opt into the v1 view via
  `--schema=1` on the CLI (or the request's `schemaVersion` field over
  the socket).
- **Exit-code categories are stable.** The six exit codes in §3 do not
  get reassigned across `schemaVersion` bumps — agents can branch on
  them confidently without parsing JSON.
- **The socket path is stable.** Per-user Unix socket / named pipe
  paths in §2A don't change across `schemaVersion: 1` patch releases.
- **camelCase everywhere.** Every JSON field on the wire is camelCase
  (`projectId`, `lastActivityAt`, `schemaVersion`, …). No snake_case
  outliers. Pre-freeze adjustment under M6 — see §5.1.

If a future change feels load-bearing enough to risk these promises, it
gets a `schemaVersion` bump.

### 1.1 Stable identifier sets

The following enum / discriminant strings are **stable identifiers** —
agents pattern-match on them, additions are non-breaking, renames /
removals require a `schemaVersion: 2` bump.

#### Error discriminants — CLI-visible (5)

These are what the `error` field on the CLI error envelope (§6) can
hold. Each maps 1-1 to an exit code (§3):

| `error`            | Exit code | When                                                              |
| ------------------ | --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `internal`         | 1         | Unexpected server failure                                         |
| `invalid_args`     | 2         | Argument validation failed                                        |
| `not_found`        | 3         | Resource missing                                                  |
| `db_unavailable`   | 4         | DB unopenable / Galley Core not running                           |
| `runner_error`     | 5         | Runner subprocess unreachable / IPC dispatch failed after persist |

#### Error discriminants — socket-wire only (4)

These appear on the socket transport envelope (§2A) for transport-level
failures. They surface to the CLI as exit code 1 (`internal`) so SOPs
get a clean error path; the JSON envelope carries the original tag.

| `error`            | Surfaces as | When                                                 |
| ------------------ | ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `unknown_command`  | exit 1      | Server doesn't know that command name (version skew) |
| `schema_mismatch`  | exit 1      | Client's `schemaVersion` != server's accepted set    |
| `not_implemented`  | exit 1      | Command name reserved but no handler wired           |
| `idle_timeout`     | exit 1      | Long-lived stream sat idle past 90s                  |

#### Status enums

| Enum                       | Values                                                                                |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `SessionBrief.status`      | `idle / connecting / running / waiting_approval / error / completed / cancelled / archived` |
| `MessageBrief.role`        | `user / agent / system` (DB `tool` rows normalize to `agent`)                         |
| `HealthCheck.status`       | `ok / warn / fail / deferred_b4` (new `deferred_<phase>` values are additive)         |
| `Origin.via`               | `gui / cli / supervisor / system`                                                     |

#### `dispatch` values (per-command)

The `dispatch` field uses different value sets per command — semantics
differ enough that a blanket `dispatch == "dispatched"` pattern would
mislead. SOPs branch per command:

| Command                          | Possible `dispatch` values                         |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `session send`                   | `dispatched` / `persisted_only`                    |
| `session new`                    | `dispatched` (exit 5 if runner cannot start/send)  |
| `session btw`                    | `dispatched` (only — exit 5 on no bridge)          |
| `session stop`                   | `abort_sent` / `already_stopped`                   |
| `llm set`                        | `dispatched` / `persisted_only`                    |

#### `stream.reason` values (subscription commands)

For NDJSON stream-end frames on `session watch` (§5.5b):

| `reason`             | Meaning                                          |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `subprocess_exited`  | Runner subprocess exited cleanly                 |
| `subprocess_error`   | Runner subprocess died unexpectedly              |
| `cancelled`          | Client disconnected (SIGINT / closed socket)     |

### 1.2 Schema pinning

SOPs that want to defend against future schema bumps can pin to
`schemaVersion: 1` explicitly:

- **CLI**: pass `--schema=1` on any command (global flag). Mismatch
  with the binary's accepted set → exit 2 (`error: "invalid_args"`) +
  message prefixed `schema_mismatch:`. v0.2 beta binaries only know `1`;
  future binaries that speak multiple versions will accept any in
  their supported set.
- **Socket**: include `"schemaVersion": 1` in the request JSON.
  Mismatch surfaces as the wire `schema_mismatch` discriminant (§2A);
  CLI maps that to exit 1 (`internal`) since it's a server-side
  negotiation failure rather than client input.

Omitting the pin uses the server's default. Today that's `1`; a future
multi-schema binary will document its default + the supported set on
`galley version`.

SOPs that want forward compatibility instead can omit the pin and
rely on the additive-only promise: new fields appear, but the ones
they read keep their names + semantics inside `schemaVersion: 1`.

## 2 · Where to find things

- **Database location.** The CLI reads the same SQLite file the Galley
  GUI writes to. Default paths:
  - macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/app.galley/workbench.db`
  - Linux: `$XDG_DATA_HOME/app.galley/workbench.db` or
    `~/.local/share/app.galley/workbench.db`
  - Windows: `%APPDATA%/app.galley/workbench.db`
- **Override.** Set `GALLEY_DB_PATH=<absolute-path>` to point at a
  specific file (snapshots, isolated test fixtures, etc.).
- **Identifier.** `app.galley` is the Tauri bundle identifier — do not
  change without a coordinated migration (see
  [desktop runtime](./desktop-runtime.md#tauri-identifier)).

## 2A · Transports

Galley CLI commands reach Galley Core through one of two transports
depending on whether the command is read-only or writes state.

### Read-only commands → direct SQLite

`sessions list / search`, `session brief / show`, `status`, `health`,
`version` open the SQLite file directly via `GALLEY_DB_PATH` (or the
platform default path in §2). **No daemon required.** Useful when:

- Galley GUI isn't running but the agent wants to inspect history
- A CI / cron job wants to scrape session state from a snapshot DB

These commands return the same JSON whether or not Galley Core is
running — they don't talk to it.

### Write commands → local socket

`session send`, `session watch`, and all future B-phase write commands
connect to a per-user local socket served by a running Galley Core
process:

- **macOS / Linux**: Unix domain socket at `$TMPDIR/galley-$UID.sock`
  (typically `/tmp/galley-501.sock`). Permission `0600` — only the
  owning OS user can connect.
- **Windows**: Named pipe at `\\.\pipe\galley-$USERNAME`, scoped to
  the calling user's namespace.

**No TCP, no token, no TLS.** Auth = filesystem permission (Unix) /
user-scoped namespace (Windows). Cross-machine access goes through
GA's IM frontends + Galley CLI on the host machine, not directly to
this socket. See [CLAUDE.md "Galley 架构原则 #1 Localhost only"](../CLAUDE.md).

#### Wire format (NDJSON)

Every request is a single JSON object on one line; the server replies
with one JSON line for unary commands, or a stream of NDJSON lines for
subscription commands like `session watch`.

Request:

```json
{
  "command": "session.send",
  "args": { /* command-specific */ },
  "schemaVersion": 1,
  "requestId": "any-client-string-for-demux"
}
```

Unary response (success):

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "requestId": "...",
  "result": { /* command-specific */ }
}
```

Unary response (error):

```json
{
  "ok": false,
  "requestId": "...",
  "error": "not_found",
  "message": "human-readable explanation"
}
```

Stream response (for subscription commands):

```json
{"stream": "event", "requestId": "...", "data": { /* event payload */ }}
{"stream": "event", "requestId": "...", "data": { /* ... */ }}
{"stream": "end",   "requestId": "...", "reason": "subprocess_exited"}
```

#### Wire-level error discriminants

These are stable identifiers — agents pattern-match on them:

| `error`            | Meaning                                                              |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `invalid_args`     | Argument validation failed (missing field, bad JSON)                 |
| `not_found`        | Target resource missing (no session with that id, etc.)              |
| `db_unavailable`   | DB file missing / unopenable / Galley Core not running               |
| `unknown_command`  | Server doesn't know that command name                                |
| `schema_mismatch`  | Client's `schemaVersion` != server's accepted version                |
| `not_implemented`  | Command name reserved but no handler wired (transitional state)     |
| `idle_timeout`     | Connection sat idle past 90s — server politely closed                |
| `internal`         | Unexpected server failure                                            |

The CLI maps each tag onto the §3 exit code table when surfacing the
error.

#### Race detection at startup

If a second Galley Core process tries to start while another is
already bound to the same socket path, it logs a diagnostic and
returns without binding (so the first instance keeps owning the
socket). Stale sockets from crashed previous processes get unlinked
and rebound automatically.

A sub-millisecond race window exists between try-connect and rebind;
in practice it's never been hit. If it does happen, the second
instance exits its socket setup and CLI clients see `exit 4` until
the user restarts.

## 3 · Exit codes

| Code | Category          | When                                                        |
| ---- | ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `0`  | success           | command completed; output (if any) is on stdout             |
| `1`  | `internal`        | unexpected failure (sqlx bug, FS race, etc.)                |
| `2`  | `invalid_args`    | argument validation failed (unknown `--status` value, …)    |
| `3`  | `not_found`       | requested resource missing (`session brief <id>` no row)    |
| `4`  | `db_unavailable`  | DB file missing / unopenable / corrupted; Galley Core not reachable on socket |
| `5`  | `runner_error`    | runner subprocess unreachable / IPC dispatch failed after persist (`session btw` no live bridge, `llm set` runner write fail) |

Exit codes are reserved categories — they do not get reassigned. A new
error class would take the next free code (`6`, `7`, …) without
disturbing `1–5`.

## 4 · Output discipline

- **Success → JSON on stdout.** List-returning commands emit **NDJSON**
  (one object per line) so streaming parsers like `jq -c` work without
  buffering.
- **Errors → JSON on stdout.** Same stream as success, with the
  envelope in §6. Exit code carries the category for SOPs that don't
  want to parse JSON.
- **stderr is reserved.** Only Rust runtime panics / backtraces show up
  there. Safe to pipe `2>/dev/null` when you only care about the
  protocol output.
- **No colour codes / TTY frills.** Output is byte-identical whether
  attached to a TTY or piped.

## 5 · Commands

### 5.1 · `galley version`

Returns the CLI version + the schema version of its output protocol.

```bash
$ galley version
{"galleyVersion":"0.2.0-beta.1","schemaVersion":1}
```

Response fields:

| Field            | Type   | Notes                                              |
| ---------------- | ------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `galleyVersion`  | string | semver of the `galley` binary itself               |
| `schemaVersion`  | int    | this document's stability key (`1` for v0.2.x beta) |

### 5.2 · `galley sessions list [--runtime=current|managed|external|all] [--project=X] [--status=Y] [--archived | --all]`

Lists sessions in `pinned DESC, last_activity_at DESC` order. NDJSON,
one `SessionBrief` per line.

| Flag         | Type   | Default      | Notes                                                                                             |
| ------------ | ------ | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--runtime`  | enum   | `current`    | `current` follows the GUI's active runtime; `all` is explicit cross-runtime listing                |
| `--project`  | string | (unset)      | restrict to one project id                                                                        |
| `--status`   | string | (unset)      | one of `idle / connecting / running / waiting_approval / error / completed / cancelled / archived` |
| `--archived` | bool   | false        | return only archived sessions                                                                     |

Default behaviour: current runtime only, archived excluded (matches GUI
sidebar default).

Example:

```bash
$ galley sessions list --project=proj_demo
{"id":"s-abc","title":"first chat","status":"idle","turnCount":3,"lastActivityAt":"…","createdAt":"…","updatedAt":"…","pinned":false,"hasUnread":false}
{"id":"s-def","title":"second chat","status":"completed","turnCount":12,"lastActivityAt":"…","createdAt":"…","updatedAt":"…","pinned":false,"hasUnread":false}

### 5.3 · `galley sessions search <query> [--all]`

FTS5 trigram search over message bodies. Two-character queries fall
back to LIKE substring search. Queries shorter than two characters
return empty.

| Flag     | Default | Notes                                  |
| -------- | ------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `--all`  | false   | include archived sessions in the scan  |

Example:

```bash
$ galley sessions search "ndjson"
{"sessionId":"s-abc","messageId":"m1","snippet":"… emit <mark>ndjson</mark> on stdout …","rank":-1.234}
```

`SearchHit` fields:

| Field        | Type   | Notes                                                                          |
| ------------ | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `sessionId`  | string | the session containing the hit                                                 |
| `messageId`  | string | the matching message id                                                        |
| `snippet`    | string | excerpt with matches wrapped in `<mark>…</mark>`; HTML-safe                    |
| `rank`       | float  | FTS5 BM25 score (lower = better). `0.0` when the LIKE fallback returned the hit |

### 5.4 · `galley session brief <id>`

One `SessionBrief` for the given id, or exit `3 not_found`.

```bash
$ galley session brief s-abc
{"id":"s-abc","title":"…","status":"idle", …}

$ galley session brief sess_missing ; echo "exit: $?"
{"error":"not_found","detail":{"message":"session sess_missing not found"}}
exit: 3
```

### 5.5 · `galley session show <id> [--tail=N]`

Conversation messages for a session, oldest first. NDJSON, one
`MessageBrief` per line.

| Flag     | Default          | Notes                                              |

| `role`        | string enum     | `user / agent / system`. `tool` rows surface as `agent`               |
| `content`     | string          | raw markdown body                                                     |

| `summary`     | string?         | agent-supplied one-line digest of this turn (assistant rows only)     |
| `turnIndex`   | int?            | which user-message-turn this message belongs to                       |
| `origin`      | `Origin`?       | source of this message (B2+; omitted on rows from before migration 006) |

### 5.5a · `galley session send <id> "<content>" [--supervisor=<x>] [--reason=<y>]`

**Write command** — persists a user message into a session and dispatches
it to the live runner subprocess. Requires Galley Core to be running
(exit `4 db_unavailable` if the socket isn't reachable).

| Flag           | Default                                  | Notes                                                                |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--supervisor` | (none → `origin.via = cli`)              | Supervisor label. When set, `origin.via` upgrades to `supervisor`.   |
| `--reason`     | (none)                                   | Free-text rationale. Stored on `messages.origin_note`; appears in audit views. |

```bash
$ galley session send sess_abc "summarize the last turn" \
    --supervisor=ga-claude-1 --reason="user said tldr"
{"message":{"id":"msg_…","sessionId":"sess_abc","role":"user","content":"summarize the last turn", \
"createdAt":"2026-05-19T…","turnIndex":3,"origin":{"via":"supervisor","supervisor":"ga-claude-1","reason":"user said tldr"}}, \
"dispatch":"dispatched"}
```

Response shape:

| Field      | Type          | Notes                                                                             |
| ---------- | ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `message`  | `MessageBrief`| The persisted row, including server-assigned `id` + `createdAt`                   |
| `dispatch` | string enum   | `"dispatched"` if the runner received the command on stdin; `"persisted_only"` if no runner is alive (LRU-evicted / crashed / never spawned) — the row is in SQLite either way |

**Semantics**: fire-and-forget. The CLI returns as soon as the message
is persisted; it does **not** wait for the runner to complete the
agent turn. Pair with `galley session watch <id>` if you need to see
the resulting events. See [B2 playbook running note N34] for the
rationale.

**Origin handling**: if you pass `--supervisor`, the stored
`origin.via` is `supervisor`. Without it, it's `cli`. Use
`--supervisor` for SOP-driven invocations so audit logs can filter by
agent identity.

Exit codes: `0` success / `3 not_found` (session missing) /
`2 invalid_args` (session archived, malformed args) /
`4 db_unavailable` (Galley Core not running).

### 5.5b · `galley session watch <id>`

**Subscription command** — streams live IPC events from a session's
runner subprocess on stdout (one event per line, NDJSON). The
connection stays open until either:

- the subprocess exits (server sends `{"stream":"end","reason":"subprocess_exited"}` then closes), or
- the client sends SIGINT (Ctrl-C) / the process exits

Requires Galley Core to be running and a live runner for the target
session.

```bash
$ galley session watch sess_abc
{"stream":"event","requestId":null,"data":{"kind":"turn_start","sessionId":"sess_abc",…}}
{"stream":"event","requestId":null,"data":{"kind":"tool_call_start",…}}
{"stream":"event","requestId":null,"data":{"kind":"tool_call_end",…}}
{"stream":"event","requestId":null,"data":{"kind":"turn_end",…}}
{"stream":"end","requestId":null,"reason":"subprocess_exited"}
$ # exit 0
```

The `data` payload mirrors the runner ↔ Galley Core IPC event shape
defined in [`docs/ipc-protocol.md`](./ipc-protocol.md) §4 — same
`kind` discriminator and per-event field set.

**No backlog support yet.** Subscribers see events from subscribe-time
forward only. Catching up on the recent history requires
`galley session show <id> --tail=N` first. A `--from=<event-index>`
flag is planned (see [B2 playbook running note N35]).

Exit codes: `0` clean stream end / `3 not_found` (no live runner for
that session id) / `4 db_unavailable` (Galley Core not running).

### 5.6 · `galley status`

Aggregate counts.

```bash
$ galley status
{"total":7,"running":0,"waitingInput":0,"errored":0}
```

`StatusSummary` fields:

| Field           | Type | Notes                                                                                              |
| --------------- | ---- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `total`         | int  | non-archived sessions                                                                              |
| `running`       | int  | sessions in `running` status. Note: B1 surfaces persistence-truth — these counts will usually read as 0 unless caught mid-write, since GUI only persists `archived / completed / cancelled` (transient runtime status coerced to `idle` on save). Real runtime counts arrive in B2+ via the Rust-owned runner manager. |
| `waitingInput`  | int  | sessions with `waiting_approval` status (same persistence caveat)                                  |
| `errored`       | int  | sessions in `error` status (same caveat)                                                           |

### 5.7 · `galley health`

Health probe. B1 ships a partial set — filesystem / SQLite-checkable
rows are real; Python-dependent rows (`agentmain_import`,
`llm_session_init`) report `deferred_b4` until B4 daemon mode ships.

```bash
$ galley health
{"checks":[
  {"id":"db_readable","status":"ok","detail":"/Users/.../workbench.db"},
  {"id":"ga_path","status":"ok","detail":"/Users/.../GenericAgent"},
  {"id":"mykey_py","status":"ok","detail":"/Users/.../mykey.py"},
  {"id":"agentmain_import","status":"deferred_b4","detail":"requires runner spawn — see B4 daemon"},
  {"id":"llm_session_init","status":"deferred_b4","detail":"requires runner spawn — see B4 daemon"}
]}
```

`HealthReport` fields:

| Field    | Type                 | Notes                                  |
| -------- | -------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `checks` | `HealthCheck[]`      | one entry per probe                    |

`HealthCheck` fields:

| Field    | Type        | Notes                                                                                                    |
| -------- | ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `id`     | string      | stable identifier (pattern-match on this, not the `detail` text)                                         |
| `status` | string enum | `ok / warn / fail / deferred_b4`                                                                         |
| `detail` | string?     | human-readable explanation (paths, error messages, deferral reasoning)                                   |

Probe id catalogue (will grow):

| `id`                | Cover                                                                                                |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `db_readable`       | `SELECT 1` against the resolved DB path                                                              |
| `ga_path`           | `prefs.ga_config.gaPath` is set + the path resolves to a directory                                   |
| `mykey_py`          | gated on `ga_path`; checks `<ga_path>/mykey.py` is a file                                            |
| `agentmain_import`  | B4 — `python -c "import agentmain"` against the bundled / user Python                                |
| `llm_session_init`  | B4 — instantiate one LLM session, capture the API-key resolution error if any                        |

Pattern: agents should branch on the `status` value (`ok` / `warn` /
`fail` actionable; `deferred_b4` indicates "Galley can't currently check
this — trust other signals or wait for B4").

### 5.8 · `galley session new "<task>" [--runtime=current|managed|external] [--project=<id>] [--llm=<name>] [--supervisor=<x>] [--reason=<y>]`

**Write command** — creates a session, persists the first user message
in **one SQLite transaction**, starts a runner, and dispatches the first
task. Either both DB rows commit or neither does; once the rows commit,
runner spawn/dispatch failures surface as `runner_error` (exit 5) so
agents know the delegated task did not actually start.

| Flag           | Default                              | Notes                                                                                          |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

| `--llm`        | (none → bridge default at spawn)     | LLM display name (case-insensitive). Resolved against the cached `llm_list` pref.              |
| `--runtime`    | `current`                            | Follows GUI active runtime by default. `managed` / `external` are explicit cross-runtime writes. |
| `--supervisor` | (none → `origin.via = cli`)          | Supervisor label. Sets `origin.via = supervisor` on the session row + the first message.       |
| `--reason`     | (none)                               | Free-text rationale on `origin.reason`.                                                        |

```bash
$ galley session new "summarize CLAUDE.md" --project=proj_demo --llm=glm-4.5-x \
    --supervisor=ga-claude-1 --reason="weekly review"
{"session":{"id":"s-mvr2-3a7q","title":"新对话","status":"idle",…},

```

Response:

| Field      | Type           | Notes                                                                                                  |
| ---------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `session`  | `SessionBrief` | Newly-created row. `title` is the seed `新对话`; the bridge derives a better one after the first turn. |
| `message`  | `MessageBrief` | The persisted first user message.                                                                      |
| `dispatch` | string enum    | `"dispatched"` on success. Runner start/send failure returns exit 5 instead of a success envelope.     |
| `warning`  | object?        | Present when the caller explicitly writes to a non-current runtime.                                  |

Exit codes: `0` success / `2 invalid_args` (empty `task`, unknown
`--llm`, unknown project, empty `llm_list` cache) / `3 not_found` /
`4 db_unavailable` / `5 runner_error` (session/message may be saved,
but the task did not start) / `1 internal` (commit failure — both rows
roll back).

### 5.9 · `galley session btw <id> "<question>" [--supervisor=<x>] [--reason=<y>]`

**Write command (transient)** — sends a "by the way" side question to a
running session's agent. The runner detects the `/btw` prefix and
bypasses its task queue, so the main turn keeps running and the answer
lands inline. **Not persisted to the messages table** — re-opening the
session loses the side-question thread (v0.1 transient policy, sub-plan
§1.5).

Requires an alive bridge (`exit 5` otherwise).

```bash
$ galley session btw sess_abc "what's the wall-clock time so far?"
{"dispatch":"dispatched"}
```

| Flag           | Default | Notes                                                                                                  |
| -------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `--supervisor` | (none)  | Accepted for surface symmetry; M1 doesn't act on it. Wired into the M7 supervisor action log.          |
| `--reason`     | (none)  | Same — passes through socket envelope but doesn't reach SQLite.                                        |

Exit codes: `0` success / `2 invalid_args` (empty question) /
`3 not_found` (session id) / `4 db_unavailable` /
`5 runner_error` (no live bridge for that session — `/btw` needs one).

### 5.10 · `galley session stop <id> [--reason=<y>] [--supervisor=<x>]`

**Write command** — signals the runner to abort the current turn. Maps
to `IpcCommand::Abort` (**not** `Shutdown`): the agent's loop exits and
emits `run_complete` with the `ABORTED` marker, but the bridge process
stays alive so a subsequent `session send` resumes without the 5-10s
respawn cost. Idempotent — stopping a session whose agent is already
idle returns `{dispatch: "already_stopped"}` and exit 0.

Sub-plan §1.4 explains the Abort vs Shutdown trade-off. A future
`session kill` (§8) would surface the Shutdown path.

```bash
$ galley session stop sess_abc --reason="changed my mind"
{"dispatch":"abort_sent"}

$ galley session stop sess_idle
{"dispatch":"already_stopped"}
```

| Response field | Value                                          | Meaning                                                                            |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `dispatch`     | `"abort_sent"` / `"already_stopped"`           | `abort_sent` = runner was mid-turn and received Abort; `already_stopped` = no-op.  |

Exit codes: `0` (both branches) / `3 not_found` (session id) /
`4 db_unavailable` / `5 runner_error` (rare: runner died mid-dispatch
in a way we can't recover from idempotently).

### 5.11 · `galley session archive <id> [--supervisor=<x>] [--reason=<y>]`

**Write command** — flips a session's status to `archived`. The session
disappears from the GUI sidebar's active list; reversible via
`session restore`. Thin wrapper over the `archive_session` trait method.

```bash
$ galley session archive sess_abc --supervisor=ga-claude-1 --reason="auto-cleanup"
{"session":{"id":"sess_abc","status":"archived",…}}
```

Exit codes: `0` success / `3 not_found` / `4 db_unavailable`.

### 5.12 · `galley session restore <id> [--supervisor=<x>] [--reason=<y>]`

**Write command** — inverse of `session archive`. Flips status from
`archived` back to `idle`; no-op if the session wasn't archived (returns
the brief unchanged, exit 0). Thin wrapper over the `unarchive_session`
trait method.

```bash
$ galley session restore sess_abc
{"session":{"id":"sess_abc","status":"idle",…}}
```

Exit codes: `0` success / `3 not_found` / `4 db_unavailable`.

### 5.13 · `galley session move <id> [--to=<project-id>] [--supervisor=<x>] [--reason=<y>]`

**Write command** — moves a session into a project or detaches it from
its current one. Naming follows the PRD §11.2 grammar rule "noun =
verb's subject": **session is the subject of the move**, projects don't
shuffle (sub-plan O3).

| Flag    | Default                    | Notes                                                            |
| ------- | -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--to`  | (omit → detach)            | Target project id. Omit to move the session to ungrouped.        |

```bash
$ galley session move sess_abc --to=proj_demo
{"session":{"id":"sess_abc","projectId":"proj_demo",…}}

$ galley session move sess_abc        # no --to → detach
{"session":{"id":"sess_abc",…}}       # projectId now absent
```

Exit codes: `0` success / `2 invalid_args` (project id doesn't exist —
FK violation) / `3 not_found` (session id) / `4 db_unavailable`.

### 5.14 · `galley project create "<name>" [--root-path=…] [--icon=…] [--color=…] [--supervisor=<x>] [--reason=<y>]`

**Write command** — creates a project. Id is server-side minted
(`proj_<16-hex>`) so SOPs don't have to invent ids. `name` is trimmed
server-side; empty after trim → `invalid_args`.

| Flag           | Default        | Notes                                                                                                     |
| -------------- | -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--root-path`  | (none)         | Filesystem root. Stored for forward compatibility — runner spawn no longer injects this (see 2026-05-14). |
| `--icon`       | (none)         | Legacy icon metadata. Current GUI renders the standard Phosphor folder icon.                             |
| `--color`      | (none)         | Hex accent color (e.g. `#7c84ff`).                                                                       |

```bash
$ galley project create "MyApp refactor" --root-path=/Users/me/src/myapp
{"project":{"id":"proj_a1b2c3d4e5f60718","name":"MyApp refactor","rootPath":"/Users/me/src/myapp",…}}
```

Exit codes: `0` success / `2 invalid_args` (empty name) /
`4 db_unavailable`.

### 5.15 · `galley project list`

**Read-only** — direct SQLite, no socket needed. NDJSON, one
`ProjectBrief` per line, ordered `pinned DESC`, then effective project
content activity descending (matches the GUI sidebar).

```bash
$ galley project list
{"id":"proj_demo","name":"MyApp refactor","pinned":true,"lastActivityAt":"…",…}
{"id":"proj_xyz","name":"Side project","pinned":false,"lastActivityAt":"…",…}
```

`ProjectBrief` fields:

| `updatedAt`      | string (ISO8601) |                                                                      |

Exit codes: `0` success / `4 db_unavailable`.

### 5.16 · `galley project delete <project-id> [--supervisor=<x>] [--reason=<y>]`

**Destructive write command** — removes the project row. FK SET NULL
auto-detaches child sessions to ungrouped; the session rows themselves
survive. Response carries `detachedSessions` count + ids so SOPs can
surface the side effect.

Per sub-plan O2, this command is honestly named `delete` because the
operation is destructive. A future release may ship a separate
reversible `project archive` alongside (§8); schemaVersion 1 doesn't
support reversible archive.

```bash
$ galley project delete proj_demo --supervisor=ga-claude-1 --reason="merged into MyApp"
{"deleted":true,"projectId":"proj_demo","detachedSessions":3,
 "detachedSessionIds":["sess_a","sess_b","sess_c"]}
```

| Response field         | Type     | Notes                                                          |
| ---------------------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `deleted`              | bool     | Always `true` on success.                                      |
| `projectId`            | string   | Echo of the deleted id.                                        |
| `detachedSessions`     | int      | Number of sessions whose `projectId` flipped to NULL.          |
| `detachedSessionIds`   | string[] | Ids of those sessions. Empty array if no sessions were attached. |

Exit codes: `0` success / `3 not_found` / `4 db_unavailable`.

### 5.17 · `galley llm list`

**Read-only** — direct SQLite, no socket. Reads the cached `llm_list`
pref that the GUI seeds after a bridge warmup. NDJSON, one entry per
line.

```bash
$ galley llm list
{"index":0,"name":"glm-5.1","key":"NativeClaudeSession/glm-5.1","displayName":"NativeClaudeSession/glm-5.1"}
{"index":1,"name":"claude-opus-4-7","key":"NativeClaudeSession/claude-opus-4-7","displayName":"NativeClaudeSession/claude-opus-4-7"}
```

**Cache-miss is success**: an empty `llm_list` pref returns empty
stdout, exit 0 — the cache fills the first time the GUI (or a future
`llm warmup` command, §8) starts a bridge. If you suspect a stale
cache, open the GUI once to re-warm.

Exit codes: `0` success (incl. empty cache) / `2 invalid_args` (the
stored value isn't a JSON array — would indicate a future-GUI schema
drift the CLI hasn't learned about) / `4 db_unavailable`.

### 5.18 · `galley llm set <session-id> <llm-name>`

**Write command** — persists a session's per-bridge LLM choice + best-
effort tells any live runner the new pick. Two-step semantics mirror
`session send`: DB row is source of truth; runner dispatch is
opportunistic.

`<llm-name>` is matched case-insensitively against the session runtime's
model list — managed sessions resolve Galley model records; external GA
sessions resolve `galley llm list` entries. The persisted row keeps
`selectedLlmKey` so reordering models does not silently point the
session at a different model.

```bash
$ galley llm set sess_abc glm-4.5-x
{"session":{"id":"sess_abc","selectedLlmIndex":0,"selectedLlmKey":"NativeClaudeSession/glm-4.5-x","selectedLlmDisplayName":"glm-4.5-x",…},
 "dispatch":"dispatched"}

$ galley llm set sess_other glm-4.5-x   # no live bridge
{"session":{…},"dispatch":"persisted_only"}
```

| Response field | Type           | Notes                                                                                                  |
| -------------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `session`      | `SessionBrief` | Updated row (carries `selectedLlmKey` plus legacy index/display companions).                            |
| `dispatch`     | string enum    | `"dispatched"` = live runner received `SetLlm`; `"persisted_only"` = no live runner (DB has the choice). |

**No Origin** flags — mirrors the trait signature: `set_session_llm`
doesn't take origin (LLM picks happen on every bridge `ready` event,
not just user actions, so an audit trail wouldn't be meaningful).

Exit codes: `0` success / `2 invalid_args` (unknown LLM name; empty
cache) / `3 not_found` (session id) / `4 db_unavailable` /
`5 runner_error` (live bridge present but stdin write failed).

## 6 · Error envelope

### CLI error envelope

Every CLI error — read or write — uses the same shape on stdout:

```json
{
  "error":  "not_found" | "invalid_args" | "db_unavailable" | "runner_error" | "internal",
  "message": "<human-readable explanation>"
}
```

- `error` is a stable discriminant (matches the `GalleyError` enum
  variants in [`core/src/error.rs`](../core/src/error.rs)).
- `message` is the human-readable explanation. Top-level so SOPs can
  read one shape across both transports (B4 M6 freeze).
- A future v1-additive `detail` object can carry structured context
  (`sessionId`, `path`, `expected`, …) without breaking parsers that
  already pattern-match on `error` + `message`.

Example:

```bash
$ galley session brief sess_missing ; echo "exit: $?"
{"error":"not_found","message":"session sess_missing not found"}
exit: 3
```

### Socket error envelope

Write commands invoke the local socket transport. The socket envelope
wraps the same `error` / `message` fields with `ok: false` + the
caller's `requestId` so a single connection can multiplex many
in-flight requests:

```bash
$ galley session send sess_missing "hi" ; echo "exit: $?"
{"ok":false,"requestId":null,"error":"not_found","message":"session 'sess_missing' does not exist"}
exit: 3
```

The CLI maps each `error` discriminant onto an exit code via the §3
table. Future error classes get their own discriminant; v1 won't
rename existing ones.

## 6A · Shared types

### `Origin`

Records the source of a write. Required on every write command;
optional on read responses (older rows from before migration 006
omit it).

| Field         | Type            | Notes                                                                  |
| ------------- | --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `via`         | string enum     | `gui` / `cli` / `supervisor` / `system`. Matches the SQL CHECK constraint on `messages.created_via` and `sessions.created_via` |
| `supervisor`  | string?         | Supervisor label / agent identity (e.g. `"ga-claude-1"`). Required when `via=supervisor`; absent for `via=gui` / `via=system`; optional for `via=cli` (presence with `via=cli` would indicate a manual terminal user impersonating a supervisor — Galley doesn't reject it but supervisors should prefer `via=supervisor` to claim identity) |
| `reason`      | string?         | Free-text rationale. Shows up in audit / activity-log views. Recommended on destructive operations + autonomous (non-user-relayed) judgments |

The CLI auto-elevates `via` based on `--supervisor`: pass `--supervisor=<id>`
on any write command → stored `via = supervisor`; omit it → `via = cli`.
The GUI always writes `via = gui`. `via = system` is reserved for
internal Galley triggers (auto-clear-unread, lifecycle events, etc.).

Wire example:

```json
{"via": "supervisor", "supervisor": "ga-claude-1", "reason": "user said tldr"}
```

## 7 · Versioning

`schemaVersion: 1` is **frozen for v0.2.0-beta.1** (B4 M6). The rules in §1
apply.

Inside `schemaVersion: 1`:

- Adding a new command, flag, or output field is **non-breaking**.
- Adding a new value to a string enum (status, error, health status,
  …) is **non-breaking** — agents must handle unknown values
  gracefully (default branch).
- Adding a new error discriminant on the socket transport (e.g. a new
  not-yet-known cause for `not_implemented`) is **non-breaking**.
- Adding the v1-additive `detail` object to error envelopes is
  **non-breaking** — parsers that read `error` + `message` keep
  working.
- Removing or renaming a command / flag / field / enum value is
  **breaking**. Don't.

Inside a future `schemaVersion: 2`:

- A breaking change can ship.
- Both the CLI (`--schema=1`) and the socket (`schemaVersion` in the
  request) will support opting back into the v1 view; old SOPs keep
  working until they choose to migrate.

`galley version` returns the schema version the CLI binary is willing
to speak. The socket `version` command returns the server's accepted
schema version. Future binaries that speak multiple versions will
expose this as an array.

## 8 · Planned (future B-phases)

The following are intentionally **not in `schemaVersion: 1` CLI surface
yet** — mentioned here so SOPs can plan their integration shape.
Additions will be non-breaking inside `schemaVersion: 1` per §7.

- `galley session kill <id>` — runner Shutdown (vs `session stop` which
  Aborts the turn but keeps the bridge alive). Deferred to a future release,
  pending dogfood evidence that bridge-wedge cases are common enough
  to warrant a destructive surface ([B4 M1 sub-plan O6](./refactor/B4-M1-sub-plan.md)).
- `galley project archive <id>` — true reversible archive (current
  `project delete` is destructive; a future schema can add an
  `archived_at` column and ship this as a separate command without
  changing the existing `delete` semantics — sub-plan O2).
- `galley session watch <id> --from=<event-index>` — backlog/resume
  support for supervisors reconnecting after a network blip (B2 N35).
- `galley llm warmup <id>` — explicit "spawn a bridge so `llm list`
  cache fills" command, for SOPs that don't want to rely on the GUI
  having been opened.

All future write commands will accept `--supervisor=<x>` /
`--reason=<y>` flags following the same Origin convention `session send`
uses today (§5.5a). Read commands stay flag-light.

### 8A · `GalleyApi` trait surface (B3 M4a)

The full session/project CRUD trait landed in B3 M4a as the
authoritative write path. **B4 M1 minted CLI subcommands for the
supervisor-facing subset** (`session new / archive / restore / move`,
`project create / list / delete`, `llm set` — see §5.8-§5.18). The
methods below remain trait-only because the GUI invokes them through
direct interactions (rename via text input, pinned via right-click,
bulk via multi-select) and there's no SOP-driven scenario that needs
them outside the GUI. If a v0.6+ supervisor workflow demands them,
they get minted as new CLI subcommands additively.

Trait signatures (Rust types):

| Method | Args | Returns |
|---|---|---|
| `create_session` | `CreateSessionInput`, `Origin` | `SessionBrief` |
| `archive_session` | `SessionId`, `Origin` | `SessionBrief` |
| `unarchive_session` | `SessionId`, `Origin` | `SessionBrief` |
| `rename_session` | `SessionId`, `title: String`, `Origin` | `SessionBrief` |
| `set_session_pinned` | `SessionId`, `pinned: bool`, `Origin` | `SessionBrief` |
| `delete_session` | `SessionId`, `Origin` | `()` |
| `assign_session_to_project` | `SessionId`, `Option<String>`, `Origin` | `SessionBrief` |
| `set_session_llm` | `SessionId`, `index: Option<u32>`, `key: Option<String>`, `display_name: Option<String>` | `SessionBrief` |
| `bump_session_after_turn` | `SessionId`, `Option<String>`, `Option<u32>`, `mark_unread: bool` | `SessionBrief` |
| `clear_session_unread` | `SessionId` | `()` |
| `bulk_archive_sessions` | `Vec<SessionId>`, `Origin` | `u32` |
| `bulk_unarchive_sessions` | `Vec<SessionId>`, `Origin` | `u32` |
| `bulk_delete_sessions` | `Vec<SessionId>`, `Origin` | `u32` |
| `list_projects` | — | `Vec<ProjectBrief>` |
| `create_project` | `CreateProjectInput`, `Origin` | `ProjectBrief` |
| `update_project` | `ProjectId`, `ProjectPatch`, `Origin` | `ProjectBrief` |
| `delete_project` | `ProjectId`, `Origin` | `()` |

Input types (camelCase on the JSON wire):

- `CreateSessionInput { id, title, projectId?, selectedLlmIndex?, selectedLlmKey?, selectedLlmDisplayName?, gaRuntimeKind?, gaRuntimeId?, promptProfile? }`
  — `id` is caller-assigned (`s-<base36>-<rand>` convention; conflicts
  surface as `invalid_args`).
- `CreateProjectInput { id, name, rootPath?, icon?, color? }` —
  same id-assigned-by-caller convention (`proj_<random16>`).
- `ProjectPatch { name?, rootPath??, icon??, color??, pinned? }` —
  the `?` (Option) means "leave the column alone"; the `??`
  (double-Option) on `rootPath` / `icon` / `color` means
  `Some(None)` clears the column to SQL NULL while `Some(Some(v))`
  writes `v`.

Error categories (all map to the §3 exit codes):

- `not_found` — session or project id doesn't exist.
- `invalid_args` — empty title / name after trim, id conflict, archived
  session pin attempt, FK violation (project_id pointing at nothing).
- `db_unavailable` — DB pool can't open.

### Transport notes

For the **transport**: the read commands' direct-SQLite path is a B1
convenience kept for "Galley Core not running" scenarios (snapshot
inspection, CI). The write commands' socket path is the eventual
canonical path for everything; B4 may consolidate read commands onto
it too once daemon mode is the dogfood baseline.
