/**
 * Runtime payload types — desktop-side.
 *
 * Historical note (2026-05-12): this file is named `inspector.ts`
 * because the shapes here originally fed a right-pane Inspector with
 * Details / Approvals / Runtime tabs. That panel was retired and
 * `ApprovalRecord` (the audit log shape) went with it; `RuntimeInfo`
 * still drives Settings → Runtime. The filename stays the same to
 * avoid a wave of import-path churn — rename to `runtime.ts`
 * whenever we're already touching every importer.
