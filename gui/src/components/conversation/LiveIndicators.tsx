/**
 * Blinking cursor appended to mid-turn streaming content. GA throttles
 * its display_queue to push ~50-char deltas, which without this
 * affordance creates the "chunk appears, then dead silence, then
 * another chunk" experience the user reported. The cursor keeps a
 * liveness signal on screen during the gap between pushes.
 *
 * Real fix (token-level streaming) requires a GA-side change —
 * tracked separately. This is the UI-side mitigation only.
 *
 * Width 2px / height 1em matches a thin caret; brand-tinted at 70%
 * so it reads as agentic, not a system caret.
