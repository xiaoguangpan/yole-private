/**
 * Epigraph — Part A of the philosophical-voice feature. A single
 * state-bound Wittgenstein line shown above the empty-state Composer.
 *
 * Two lines: the translated line in the user's software language on
 * top, the German original on an always-on secondary line beneath it
 * (no hover gate, so touch / keyboard users see it too). The German
 * line sits one step quieter in weight/opacity.
 *
 * Visual weight is deliberately subordinate to the Composer — quiet,
 * serif, ink-muted; it must read as a quiet epigraph, not a header or
 * banner. Exactly one entry renders; there is no rotation or timer.
 * The region is non-interactive and labeled for screen readers without
 * stealing focus.
 *
 * See `.kiro/specs/philosophical-voice/` (Requirements 1, 2, 5).
