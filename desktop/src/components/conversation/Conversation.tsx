 *   - hr-soft    : 60% centered, between turns. Quiet pacing.

 * Both kinds use --color-line; the strong one uses line-strong width
 * via the visual contrast of full-width vs 60% rather than a different
 * color. (DESIGN.md says "稍深 1px 全宽 vs 极淡 1px 60% 居中"; opacity
 * 60% on the soft one approximates the prototype.)

 * Per-step header — sits above each agent turn's thinking summary

 *   - mt-7 (28px) gives turn-to-turn breathing room comparable to
 *     the old SoftHr's my-5 (40px) without the visual noise of an
 *     actual rule
 *   - serif italic + muted ink puts it in the same voice family as
 *     the other "soft prompt" UI text in the product
 *     ("你想做什么？" / "这里会出现你的 sessions" / TopBar
 *     placeholder). The previous mono+uppercase+tracking treatment
 *     read as a sysmon log line and clashed with the Notion+Claude
 *     register the product is aiming for.
 *   - 12px keeps it from competing with the thinking summary that
 *     follows.
 *
 * Why "第 N 步" and not "第 N 轮": Chinese 「轮」 collides with
 * conversational round (user message N), which is the natural
 * mental model — users seeing "第 1 轮" on their second message
 * would be confused. GA's turn is a finer-grained concept (one
 * LLM call + tool dispatch cycle inside agent_runner_loop), and
 * 「步」 (step) is the natural Chinese word for that level of
 * granularity. The N is GA's turn_index (one user message can
 * trigger multiple steps), not the array position.
