  // tools, so the *final* answer is the turn that contains nothing
  // but `no_tool` placeholders. (agent_loop.py line 63 synthesizes
  // a `[{tool_name: 'no_tool', args: {}}]` entry on turns where the
  // LLM produced no tool_calls — so `tools.length === 0` would
  // never be true even on the actual final turn. The placeholder is

/**
 * Per-step header — sits above each agent turn's thinking summary
 * AND carries the chapter-break weight between turns now that
 * SoftHr is gone. Tuned for that double role:
 *   - mt-7 (28px) gives turn-to-turn breathing room comparable to
 *     the old SoftHr's my-5 (40px) without the visual noise of an
 *     actual rule
 *   - serif italic + muted ink puts it in the same voice family as
 *     the other "soft prompt" UI text in the product
 *     ("你想做什么？" / "这里会出现你的 sessions" / TopBar
 *     placeholder). The previous mono+uppercase+tracking treatment
 *     read as a sysmon log line and clashed with the Notion+Claude
 *     register the product is aiming for.
 *   - 12px keeps it from competing with the thinking summary that
 *     follows.
 *
 * Why "第 N 步" and not "第 N 轮": Chinese 「轮」 collides with
 * conversational round (user message N), which is the natural
 * mental model — users seeing "第 1 轮" on their second message
 * would be confused. GA's turn is a finer-grained concept (one
 * LLM call + tool dispatch cycle inside agent_runner_loop), and
 * 「步」 (step) is the natural Chinese word for that level of
 * granularity. The N is GA's turn_index (one user message can
 * trigger multiple steps), not the array position.
 *
 * Two-state component: `thinking` (in-flight, with TypingDots) and
 * settled (with optional summary). Sharing the same visual register
 * across both states makes the step's before/after read as a
 * single per-step rhythm rather than two unrelated UI elements.
 * Previously the in-flight state lived inside a ThinkingSummary
 * callout block — that chrome was sized for multi-paragraph agent
 * thinking content, not a one-liner "still working" placeholder.
